# Web Form to Google Sheet (*No Backend*)

A simple example of sending data from an ordinary web form
straight to a Google Spreadsheet *without a server*.

## Why? (*context*)

A *friend* called and asked for a *favor*:

> "*Can you set up a* ***web form***
*that* ***posts data*** *to a*
***Google Spreadsheet***  
***without*** *a (server)* ***backend***...?
*(We need it done by tomorrow)*"

*Never* one to turn down a chance to help a *friend*
and *learn* something new, I agreed to the task!

## Whaaaat? (*you can build things without backend?!*)
